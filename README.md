ARMDS is a set of scripts to do various cool things via APRS. Most notibly at this time, act as a micro blogging service. ARMDS will receive an APRS message and turn it into a blog like post and post to a [twtxt](https://jointwt.org/) file for viewing in your favorite client. You can also retrieve information that other users have posted via APRS.

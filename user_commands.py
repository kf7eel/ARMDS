# Version "1", by Eric, KF7EEL

# This is a split from the shark-py-sms project to allow an APRS only setup.
# This is to accomodate users who do not use DMR but wish to still have an interactive
# messaging setup. This should work with any APRS compatable radio, even bridged DMR systems.
# https://github.com/kf7eel/shark-py-sms

# Feel free to modify and improve.
